/**
 * Layers' DEX: rules of the assets from Consensus::SidechainParams::dex_height (doc/layers.md, "The DEX").
 *
 *  - **Routes.** An order trades through up to MAX_ROUTE_ASSETS - 1 pools in one transaction (Route; a
 *    Swap is a route of one hop), with one least amount out for the whole path; each hop pays its pool's
 *    0.3 %.
 *  - **Batch clearing.** Orders do not trade when their transaction is applied: they wait for the end of
 *    the block (State::FinishBlock), where every order of the block clears together, a hop at a time
 *    (round k clears the k-th hop of every order still in), each pool at one uniform price per round
 *    (ClearPool). An order whose result misses its min_out does not fill: what it paid in comes back to
 *    it, and its transaction, valid, pays its fee. Orders that miss are taken out and the rest cleared
 *    again from the start, MAX_CLEARING_PASSES times at most; past that, the block's orders execute one
 *    after another in block order, each alone, each that misses refunded (the rules before the DEX).
 *  - **TWAP.** Each pool keeps price accumulators as Uniswap v2 does: at the end of every block that
 *    changes it, the price the pool had since its last change, times the seconds since then, is added
 *    (UQ64.64, modulo 2^256). The time is the block's (nTime: the slot's time for a block of stake, the
 *    header's for a BMM block), never less than the last. Each such block leaves an observation, the
 *    last TWAP_OBSERVATIONS of each pool kept (a ring).
 *  - **Oracles.** An oracle is its key, registered with a proof of possession and a name that labels
 *    it (the fee, ORACLE_REGISTRATION_FEE, goes to mainchain miners); it attests the value of an event once, signed (BIP340) over
 *    AttestationHash. Oracle contracts lock an amount and pay it to the outcome the attestation names.
