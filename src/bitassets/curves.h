/**
 * The DEX's pool kinds (doc/layers.md, "Pool kinds"): the curves of the pools, in exact integer arithmetic.
 *
 * Every number the rules take from a curve is defined as the floor or ceiling of an exact quantity (the
 * largest amount out for which the pool's invariant does not fall, the largest number of shares whose
 * part of the invariant the deposit covers): it does not depend on how it is found. The search here is a
 * bisection over integers, each step an exact comparison of the invariant at a point with its level
 * (Level::Holds: products of integers of any size, BigUint). So every implementation that finds the same
 * floors agrees bit for bit, whatever its iteration; there is no fixed-point approximation, and no
 * rounding but at the end, toward the pool.
 *
 *  - Constant product: x·y = k (the pools AddLiquidity makes, at any fee tier).
 *  - StableSwap (Curve, two assets): 4A(X+Y) + D = 4AD + D³/(4XY), on X = x·10^scale0 and Y = y·10^scale1
 *    (the assets' decimals told apart). The level of a point is D, its exact root; a point holds a level D
 *    if Φ(X, Y, D) = 16A·XY(X+Y) + 4XY·D − 16A·D·XY − D³ ≥ 0. A pool compares points to the ceiling of its
 *    D (so it never takes less than the exact curve gives).
 *  - Weighted (Balancer, two assets): x^wa · y^wb = k, wa:wb the weights in lowest terms (80/20 is 4:1).
 *    A point holds the level of (x0, y0) if x^wa · y^wb ≥ x0^wa · y0^wb, exactly.

 * takes at least A'·dy/(dy + B') of asset0 net for at most dy of asset1: dy is the largest for which that
 * point, (x + A'·dy/(dy + B'), y − dy), holds the pool's level (Level::Holds). As dy grows that point
 * moves along a hyperbola that crosses the convex level curve once, so the largest dy is found by
 * bisection, exactly. If no dy > 0 holds, asset1 comes in on balance (the same, sides swapped); if
 * neither, the orders of each side are crossed with one another at P = B'/A', the pool trading nothing.
