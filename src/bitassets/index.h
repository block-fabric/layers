/**
 * The search index of the assets, their pools and their auctions: what a wallet's pages search, filter,
 * sort and page through, a page at a time, however many assets there are (millions, in time), without
 * ever reading them all.
 *
 * Derived data, not state: no rule reads it. It is kept in the store of the state, under a byte of its
 * own (sidechain::DERIVED_TABLE), written at the end of each block from what the block changed (the
 * overlay's journal: the keys of the assets, tokens, pools, auctions and logos it touched, with their
 * earlier values), so that it is flushed with the state, undone with it by a reorganisation (the
 * block's undo data has its keys too), and is always at the tip: there is nothing to sync, enable or
 * rebuild apart. StoreHash leaves it out. Always on: what it costs is small next to the state it
 * indexes (doc/bitassets.md, "The search index").
 *
 * Keys, after the table byte and a byte of their own (big-endian numbers, "~" a number inverted for a
 * descending order; seq is the number of an asset):
 *   'r' seq              -> AssetRow, one per asset ever registered (retired ones are kept, flagged)
 *   'n' 0|1 name 0 seq   -> Summary: by normalised name (1: no public name, after the named ones)
 *   't' word 0 seq       -> Summary: by each word that starts after the start of the name
 *   'm' display 0 seq    -> Summary: by normalised display name (those with one)
 *   'u' word 0 seq       -> Summary: by each word that starts after the start of the display name
 *   'o' ~seq             -> Summary: newest first
 *   's' ~supply seq      -> Summary
 *   'a' ~last seq        -> Summary: the height of the last block that touched it
 *   'v' ~volume seq      -> Summary: those traded within the window only
 *   'd' ~depth seq       -> Summary: those with a pool with CHN that someone provides for only
 *   'h' height seq       -> volume of an asset in a block of the window, until it leaves the window
 *   'p' pool             -> PoolRow;  'D' ~depth, 'V' ~volume, 'C' ~change, 'N' ~created, then pool
 *   'H' height pool      -> PoolSnap: a pool in a block of the window
 *   'E' end auction      -> auctions not closed, by their last block;  'B' ~created auction -> all
 *   'i'                  -> Info: counts;  'L' -> INDEX_LAYOUT, written with the first entry
