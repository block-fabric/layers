"""Layers' own questions through the host over RPC (src/webui/remotehost.h), as the Chains app asks them:

  - the assets (BitAssets): a send of an asset, a reservation with its registration in one question (the
    registration then runs once on its authorization, without a question), described with their own rows;
  - the DEX: a swap and liquidity, with their amounts; a swap whose parameters were changed after the
    question is refused, its token used up;
  - staking (FastBlocks): a bond, asked through the host method fastblocks.bond, run with its token;
  - a withdrawal to the mainchain (the kit's describer of a sidechain).
